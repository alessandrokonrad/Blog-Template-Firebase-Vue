# Vue + Firebase Blog Template

## Getting started

This is a working blog written in Vue with Firebase as backend. I'm using Vuetify for styling (Instagram look). Check out <a href="https://anna-s-blog.firebaseapp.com/">DEMO.</a>

In order to use this blog you need to create a Firebase project. Go to the project's overview and create an app. Copy the received config data
and paste them into './src/firebase.config.js'. Then you are ready to go!
Create an user in your Firebase project, so that you can login to the blog writing page (https:.../createBlog, e.g. localhost:8080/createBlog).
